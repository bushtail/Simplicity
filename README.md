# Simplicity
Ever feel confused by Mojang not including Emerald and Obsidian armor? Are you unable to find some Netherite for tools and armor? Check out Simplicity!
 
Simplicity adds one new resource and two sets of tools and armor, horse armor included!
 
Whenever you mine Obsidian, you have a chance to completely shatter the block into an Obsidian Shard! This is a tough material with a 10% chance of dropping from Obsidian.

This material and Emeralds are the only thing you need to craft this mod's tools and armor!

Emerald equipment has the same durability as Diamond but with the enchantability of Gold.

Obsidian equipment has the same enchantability of Diamond but with double it's durability.
